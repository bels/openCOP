Notes of what I had to change in openCOP

- ccps is no longer the name of the inventory primary key
- changed the name of the date column in the replacement table to replaced_on because date is a reserved word
- made the program a little bit more flexible when it comes to databases by adding that as a configuration parameter in the config file
- changed the grantid reference in the inventory table to have matching datatypes.  Before the inventory was varchar and the grantid in the grant table was BIGINT.
- changed the grantid reference in the helpdesk table to have matching datatypes.  Before the inventory was varchar and the grantid in the grant table was BIGINT.
