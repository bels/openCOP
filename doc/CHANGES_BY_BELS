Notes of what I had to change in openCOP

- ccps is no longer the name of the inventory primary key
- changed the name of the date column in the replacement table to replaced_on because date is a reserved word
- made the program a little bit more flexible when it comes to databases by adding that as a configuration parameter in the config file
- changed the grantid reference in the inventory table to have matching datatypes.  Before the inventory was varchar and the grantid in the grant table was BIGINT.
- changed the grantid reference in the helpdesk table to have matching datatypes.  Before the inventory was varchar and the grantid in the grant table was BIGINT.
- changed the connection statement in base to work with postgresql.  I need to check it against mysql to make sure it didn't break there.
- added an auth and users table for creating users/session management
- added a dashboard
- added a admin panel
- added authentication for customers and technicians
- added sections/queues for the technicians
- created a notification library that allows the program to email the customers when needed
- the helpdesk program can now be emailed
- added extra definitions to the config file
