Notes:
	- For most short text fields I've used varchar(255) even if they are unlikely to ever require that many characters. Disk space is cheap, you see. For text fields which will, in my opinion, possibly need to contain a short essay worth of text I have used type text (which is a glob and has no size limit). Again, not effecient where disk space is concerned.
	- For primary keys I have generally used bigint which provides 20 digit numbers. Exceptions are places where I know we will never need that many, such as school ID numbers. The two digit nature of such numbers limits us to 100 uniques so it really made no sense to use anything bigger than an int.
	- If you don't like the command line you can get MySQL-Front or Mysql Administrator (more dangerous).
	- "Kind" is not really useful information. A data table stores data while a list table holds a information for combo boxes used by other tables. Generally. There is some ambiguity.
	- The reason for the strange format of this file is that it is formatted with YAML, which is computer readable as well as human readable.

				notes: 
			contact_email:

				notes: 
			deleted:

				desc: This is a binary flag 0/1 for Deleted/not deleted. When a school number is no longer in use for anything you cannot just delete the school, that causes instability in the DB when something references a nonexistant school.

				desc: The email address of one who is responsible for this section. Originally the idea was that there would be a button that could be clicked to email a ticket to this address. As of now there is no such button (because getting exchange to allow an SMTP connection from tech is non trivial) and it is not a high priority (because copy/paste works and people should be checking the helpdesk anyway).
				notes: 
	softwareconfig: # this is probably defunct atm
		Description: Defunct table. Originally to be used to describe the software set on any given computer before I decided that doing so was a maintenance nightmare and abandoned the idea in favor of a marginally less nightmarish solution.
		Kind: Dead stub.
		Notes: This will be deleted soon.
		Fields: 
			Who cares?
	status:

				notes: 
	vendor:
		Description: Names and information of vendors supplying the equipment described in the equipment table.
		Kind: Data/list
		Notes: There could easily be more fields in this table tracking more information, if I knew what might be useful to track.
		Fields: 
			vid: 
				type: bigint(20)
				desc: Arbitrary unique ID for Vendors.
				notes: Primary key, auto increment.
			name:
