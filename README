2. Installation Instructions
-------------------------------------

   A script is included that aids in setting up the database.  Currently this script only works for postgresql but there are plans
to include MySQL in the future.
   
   - Run the database setup script (sql/setup_postgresql.sh)
   - Copy the entire openCOP directory into your web root
   - Remove the doc and sql directories from webroot/openCOP
   - Modify the config file and replace all of the %%MACRO%% with appropriate values
   - Add (This assumes that your webroot is /usr/local/www.  Replace that with your webroot)
	<Directory "/usr/local/www/openCOP/"> 
	    Options ExecCGI
	    AddHandler cgi-script cgi pl
	</Directory>

3. Future Plans
-------------------------------------
   We intend on testing this application in Linux and modifying the installation instructions to include Linux specific installation issues.
We also plan on adding other database backend support including MySQL and others.  Check out our ROADMAP which is also included
with the source for a general idea of where the project is heading.
