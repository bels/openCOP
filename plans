Make 'tech notes' one to many. One ticket has many notes.

Notes table:

table notes {
	id bigint not null primary key,
	ticket bigint not null,
	note text,
	author varchar(255),
	added date,
	updated date,
}


So instead of updating just one notes field one would typically add a new one each time more information is added.

The UI would be: Existing notes show up in a div and are non-editable.
A Delete hyperlink exists nearby each one.
The Delete hyperlink will use ajax to remove the note from the notes table and javascript to remove the div from the document tree.
An Edit hyperlink exists nearby each one. This hyperlink makes the div into a textarea so that on submit the data will be passed back to the DB in its updated form.
There would be one new, empty textarea for the next note to be added. If empty the form script would not add any new note field.
author would be required.
Added and Updated dates would be managed automatically.
