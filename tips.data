0	Tip is not yet defined.  Stop slacking and add some info about this item.
100	Don't take any wooden coins. 100-series tips are for the helpdesk.
101	The Author field should contain your name. No matter who you are or who you are putting the ticket in for, you are the author and your name is required.
102	The Barcode field should contain the barcode of the computer or other piece of equipment that has the problem you are describing. If the device does not have a barcode but does have a serial number, use the Serial field instead. If there is no barcode do not put anything in the Barcode field.
103	The person who should be contacted who will have first hand knowledge of the problem and be able to explain it in detail. If this would be the same as Author feel free to leave blank.
104	The Phone field should contain the phone number of either the contact person (preferred) or the author.
105	The Email field should contain the email address of either the contact person (preferred) or the author.
106	The Location field should indicate the room in which the equipment which is experiencing trouble resides. Or, it should describe the area where the problem is felt, or most felt. Additionally, it could specify which piece of equipment in the room/area is experiencing the problem, or experiencing it the most, if there is more than one piece of equipment in the designated area which could be confused with the affected equipment.
107	The Priority field is for classifying the urgency of the problem being described. In almost all cases the priority will be "Normal" or less. If you are unsure of what the appropriate priority is use "Normal."
108	The Section field describes the class of problem being experienced. If you know for sure which section your problem is for, place it in that section. If you have any doubts at all, put it in the Helpdesk section and your Computer Analyst will review it and make further adjustments if necessary.
109	The Problem field should contain a verbose description of the problem you observed, including any details that may be important or seem related.
110	The Troubleshooting Tried field should contain a description of all steps you took while attempting to resolve the Problem described above, as well as any results of that troubleshooting and a summary of where the problem now stands.
200	Tips in the 200 range are for the inventory side.
201	The Location field is the room the equipment is in, or any other information that will help you to physically locate it. Remember: There are no firm rules. While this is usually just the room name/number it can also be "Under the oval desk in room 57" or "media offce, computer on the back wall." Do what makes sense.
202	"Inventoried by" should be your name, whoever you are. By signing this field you sign off on the inventory information and are certifying (more or less) the accuracy of it at the date and time it was entered. This is also who we'll come looking for when the equipment goes missing or needs servicing.
203	"Replacing" should hold a CCPS barcode of the equipment that was taken out when this equipment was installed. If a one-to-one swap has been done the old machine can be said to have been "replaced" by this one which is "replacing" it.
