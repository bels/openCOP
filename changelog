Changes from 0.3.3 -> 0.4 (beginning of the big feature add
* added authentication on the admin side
* added authentication on the client side
* redid the interface
* added the ability for the helpdesk system to be emailed for ticket creation
* moved some things to the config file to make implementation easier for those who do not know SQL
* switched to Template Toolkit
* switched away from CGI::Application to using some Perl modules
* broke 90% of all features
* created a script that sets up a postgresql database for use with the system

Changes from 0.3.2 -> 0.3.3
 * Report bookmarking uses shorter query strings.
 * 

Changes from 0.3.1 -> 0.3.2:
 * Changed sort order on helpdesk welcome page. Now Updated is first.
 * In reports the columns you select with are now always shown (unless they are explicitly suppressed in the config.)
 * Re-fixed the autoselection of the current school in various school select boxes.
 * Added deployed date field to inventory. This + the automatic Updated timestamp establishes a definite minimal lifespan.
 * Added notes field to inventory. This field is for any machine-specific information or commentary for which there is no more appropriate field.
 * Added a view mode so users can check ticket status in a (safer) read only manner. They can still get to edit mode when they do a barcode report (will fix that later)
 * Fixes to some of the northpoint-specific stuff.
 * Removed ability to change equipment type on a per-barcode basis. A laptop does not ever become a phone.
 * Consecutive logical ORs in report queries are now grouped. This behavior seems "correct" at least most of the time. Previously ORs did not behave as expected, or some times at all. 
 * Created some (fairly terse) documentation of tables and their relationships.
 * Now it is possible to bookmark reports. A similar feature for forms is possible if there's interest.
 * Lots of little things.
