Create a file with the format of:
--##
sql statement to execute
possibly multi-line
--$$

The filename must be in the format:
VERSION.sql
where VERSION is the version number of the release to which the sql udpates pertain. For example, version 1.0.1 would have a file named 101.sql

The updater will apply the updates in numerical order, starting with the earliest.
